        Women are a beautiful creation and are the beauty of life. Women cannot
        be defined in few words because they are a complete book of life which
        explains the every color of life. A woman sacrifices her whole life for
        her family, works from day to night for the support of her family and
        spends her whole life for others. Women can never be defeated if they
        stands against something. If they are stubborn, then they can pass
        through every trouble but do not give up. A collection of sacrifice,
        love, care, mystery, stubbornness, fun, tears, grace and beauty is
        called a “Woman”.
