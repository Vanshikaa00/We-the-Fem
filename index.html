        Women’s rights around the world is an important indicator to understand
        global well-being. A major global women’s rights treaty was ratified by
        the majority of the world’s nations a few decades ago. Yet, despite many
        successes in empowering women, numerous issues still exist in all areas
        of life, ranging from the cultural, political to the economic.

          For too long, conservative thinking on women’s health has selectively
          overlooked the influence women have on both economic opportunity and
          social stability. Conservatism is rooted in ideals of individual
          rights, liberty, and the protection of human dignity.
          <br /><br />
          To create a healthy society, We The Fem organise weekly FREE Health
          Checkup Camp at different locations. Specialized doctors conducts over
          all health check ups of women and provide free health consultations.
          Medical advices are also given to women on various health concerns.
          <br /><br />
          To increase the awareness about women health care, We The Fem organise
          free seminars and webinars to educate women about different health
          issues like PCO, HIV-AIDS, Breast-Cancer, etc. Specialized doctors and
          volunteers from around the world will educate the women about these
          health issues.
          <br /><br />
          One of the major problem which women face is of availing the cost of
          buying sanitory products. We The Fem have taken the initiative to
          provide women with sanitory products especially to those who cannot
          afford to buy them.
          <br /><br />
          Mental health problems affect women and men equally, but some are more
          common among women. Abuse is often a factor in women's mental health
          problems. Treatments need to be sensitive to and reflect gender
          differences. To resolve this issue, We The Fem provides free 1-1
          consultantation to both men and women by connecting them to a
          counselor.

          <div class="c4">
            Managing money in the midst of life’s other priorities is no easy
            task. Women of all ages and backgrounds struggle with the pressure
            to earn enough, access education, care for a family and plan
            retirement. We The Fem takes the initiative to educate women about
            complex financial decisions which would help them to achieve their
            next major milestone.
            <br /><br />
            Women have been managing household finances for the longest time.
            She has always taken the call on how much to spend on necessities
            and how much splurge. Also, within that limited amount, she has
            managed to save. By nature, women are pro at budgeting. So, start
            with it – something that you know best.  A woman who has a regular
            income should allocate her finances in a 50-30-20 ratio. About 50
            percent of the money should be spent on basic necessities and home
            expenses. About 30 percent should go toward self-care and leisure
            activities. And, 20 percent of your income should be invested. These
            numbers, however, might vary as per your priorities.

        <div class="c4">
          Most of us are potential victims of ‘body shaming’ – the widespread
          phenomenon of receiving cruel feedback when our bodies don’t meet the
          unrealistic beauty standards of our time. We spend our time lost in
          self-critical thoughts, despising our body and comparing
          ourselves unfavourably to others.<br />
          In a survey of adolescents in grades 9 to 12, more than 59% of females
          and 29% of males were trying to ‘lose weight’. Over 18% of girls and
          8% of boys had, in the last 30 days, gone without food for 24 hours or
          more – just to lose weight. 95% of people with eating disorders fall
          between the ages of 12 and 25.<br />
          There are various reasons why people of different age group are
          targeted, they’re so easily influenced by celebrities and the media;
          they overthink about other people’s judgements about us and many don’t
          even understand what’s incorrect in saying, “You aren’t fat, you’re
          beautiful.”
          <br /><br />
          Let us make each other realise that fat, tall, short, or thin are not
          insults but just characteristics. A number on the weighing machine
          cannot determine our worth. Losing weight is not our life’s work and
          counting calories is not the call of our soul.

            thanks in part to change in mindsets and opinions, but they are
            certainly not considered equal to men. One should not be
            discriminated on the basis of sex when it comes to salary, pay or
            wages. But often, women are the subject of gender based
            discrimination in the workplace. One way of illustrating this is to
            look at the gender pay gap. Equal pay for the same work is a human
            right, but time and again women are denied access to a fair and
            equal wage.

            Despite being outlawed around the world, slavery is still very
            prevalent today. According to a recent report prepared by the Walk
            Free Foundation, the International Labor Organization and the
            International Organization for Migration, there are an estimated
            40.3 million people living in slavery globally and 71% of them are
            women and girls. Modern day slavery is broken into six categories by
            the organization End Slavery Now, domestic servitude, sex
            trafficking, forced labor, bonded labor, child labor, and forced
            marriage.

          Women’s education contributes to the overall development and
          progression of a country. Women play very vital roles in our lives. A
          society lacks behind if its women weep silently. An educated woman
          builds a better environment for her family members. The lacking focus
          of development in many underdeveloped and developing countries is the
          failure to implement the growth of women. A country loses its goals of
          integral and sustainable developments when women remain uneducated and
          unempowered. Women must be exposed to platforms with equal
          opportunities and need encouragement to pursue aspiring professions
          such as- lawyers, journalists, doctors, technocrats, scientists,
          adventurists, etc.
          <br /><br />
          We at "We the Fem" organise regular meetups, online teaching sessions
          for women of all age groups. Whether you want to learn digital
          marketing or technical skills; we've got all of them covered!
